# 🧠 Engineering Standards Across All Projects

- Strict TypeScript (No `any`)
- Feature-based folder architecture
- useReducer for predictable state management
- Context API (No Redux)
- Custom reusable hooks
- Persistent localStorage state
- Lazy-loaded routes
- Performance optimization
- SaaS-grade UI polish
- Fully responsive & accessible design

---

# 🎯 Why These Projects Stand Out

These projects demonstrate:

- Advanced React architecture
- Scalable frontend system design
- Complex state management without Redux
- Data visualization expertise
- Performance optimization
- Production-ready folder structure
- SaaS-level UI engineering
- Real-world product thinking

> These are not tutorial projects.  
> These are scalable, frontend-engineered application simulations.
